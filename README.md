# js_todo
A to do list made in Javascript


This to do list was created in Javascript without any frameworks. The focus of the exercise was to work with webpack, have some interactivity from the user that updates the DOM, and have the information saved in local storage. 

Some nice features that I think worked out well was incorporating some emojis to make the buttons more fun, wastpaper basket for delete and rainbows for indicating a project as a priortiy. I also thought that the priority being marked in the main display and showing up on the list of projects on the side looked nice.
